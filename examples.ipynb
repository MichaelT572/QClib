    "Lets consider a system that, when we measure it, can only be in one of two states, 0 or 1 (such as a computer bit). Now consider a machine that prepares the system in the EXACT same way every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, when we measure the system we would expect to get the same output every time. However, given quantum observations, we have found that we may prepare a system that, upon measuring, randomly is in state 0 OR 1 despite the initial conditions being the same (this was an incredibly suprising finding; one that Einstein did not like!). To describe this strange behavior conveniently, we turn to the language of linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the system in state 0. By definition, when we measure it we will always get a 0 as long as we don't change its state. We will call this state that always returns 0, \"$\\ket{0}$\". Likewise, let \"$\\ket{1}$\" be the state that always returns 1 (this notation, $\\ket{\\text{\"label\"}}$, is known as Dirac notation). In quantum mechanics, we will consider states of our system that, upon measurement, are in state $\\ket{0}$ a portion of the time and in state $\\ket{1}$ otherwise. Specifically, we will write this strange state, labeled \"$\\ket{\\psi}$\", as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ket{\\psi} = \\alpha \\ket{0} + \\beta \\ket{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}$. (A quick note: we've written $\\ket{\\psi}$ as \"partly $\\ket{0}$, partly $\\ket{1}$\", so why are we using complex numbers? We will find later on that this choice is incredibly convenient, allowing us to encode aspects such as phase into our states. For simplicity, most examples will be shown with just real numbers however).\n",
    "\n",
    "After measurement, we let the probability of being in state $\\ket{0}$, $p_0$, be $|\\alpha|^2$, and the probability of being in state $\\ket{1}$, $p_1$, to be be $|\\beta|^2$. Clearly, these probabilities must sum to 1, hence we have $|\\alpha|^2 + |\\beta|^2 = 1$ (Why the magnitude squared? Again, this is chosen for 2 good reasons: 1. Since we decided to include complex numbers, this ensures that the probabilities are positive, real numbers and 2. Notice that in the basis $\\{ \\ket{0}, \\ket{1} \\}$, any physical state is a $\\textit{normalized vector}$; we will talk more about vector representations later).\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{Exercise 1:}$ Suppose we prepare a state that returns 0 50% of the time and 1 50% of the time. What are some choices of $\\alpha, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{C}$ that satisfy these observations? This will turn out to be a very useful state later on."
